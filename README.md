This project is primarily for hands-on experience with how Docker containers communicate with each other, how image is created and how Kubernetes automates the deployment, scaling and management of containerized applications.

This is a blog website which is having some small microservices running inside containers and a gateway server which acts as an entry point for all the requests sent by user through frontend UI.

Frontend code is written in blog-app-frontend folder.

Other microservices code and required Docker & Kubernetes related files are placed in their respective folders named as 'auth', 'post', 'gateway'
