This is a project made out of curiosity and learning purpose.
This is primarily for a hands-on experience with how Docker containers communicate with each other, how image is created and how Kubernetes manages containers and their scalability.
This is a blog website which is having some small microservices running inside containers and a gateway server which acts as an entry point for all the requests sent by user through frontend UI.
Frontend code is written in blog-app-frontend folder.
Other microservices code and required Docker & Kubernetes related files are placed in their respective folders named as 'auth', 'post', 'gateway'
